== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I better engage my audience with polls? =

*Ask high-level questions*

Don't make questions too specific. Ask about the broader topic highlighted by a current event. For example, instead of asking "Do you like Kumquats more than Plums?" you may ask "Do you like to eat exotic fruits?"

*Don't ask biased questions*

Phrase your Poll Question from an objective standpoint so people from all sides of the discussion can participate. For example, you don't want to ask a Poll phrased "Is Red the Best Color Ever?" and give only two answer choices: "(A) I Love Red!" and "(B) I hate colors". Your poll won't do well and you lose out.

*Have a daily poll*

Create a relationship with your audience so they visit daily. Write about the results of the previous day's poll so they know their votes matter. Voting only takes a few seconds, and your audience will visit everyday just to participate and make their opinions count.
